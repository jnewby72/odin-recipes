            Smoked Pork Butt is a fantastic meal for any day of the week. This
            recipe definitely takes some time, but it is well worth the wait.
        </p>
        <p>
            The recipe does not require any specific portion. Everything is up
            to your tastes.

            You will need a smoker. I have no experience with any smokers other
            than a pellet smoker. The important thing is to control the
            temperature of the smoker.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pork butt &lpar;any size&rpar;</li>
            <li>Prepared mustard &lpar;or a binder of your choice&rpar;</li>
            <li>Seasoning of your choice</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dry the pork butt with a paper towel</li>
            <li>
                Let the pork butt sit out at room temperature for an hour or so
            </li>
            <li>Set the smoker to 175&deg;F.</li>
            <li>Dry the pork butt with a paper towel again</li>
            <li>
                Apply a thin layer of binder, mustard in my case, all over the
                pork butt
            </li>
            <li>
                Season the pork butt with you seasoning of choice. Lay it on
                thick!
            </li>
            <li>Lay that delicious chunk of meat in the smoker.</li>
            <li>Let the smoker do its thing for about 8 to 10 hours.</li>
            <li>
                Remove the pork butt from the smoker and wrap the pork butt in
                aluminum foil.
            </li>
            <li>At this point, you can do one of two things:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Put the pork butt in an oven set to 250&deg;, or</li>
                <li>
                    Put the pork butt back in the smoker at a temperature of
                    250&deg;
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                Let the pork butt continue to cook until it gets to an internal
                temperature of 200 - 210&deg;F
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the pork butt has hit the correct temp, remove it from the
                oven or smoker
            </li>
            <li>
                Wrap the pork butt in old towels and sit it in a thermally
                insulated container
            </li>
            <li>
                Resting the pork butt is essential. I like to let it rest at
                least a couple of hours
            </li>
            <li>Once rested, shred that sweet, sweet meat up and serve</li>
        </ol>
